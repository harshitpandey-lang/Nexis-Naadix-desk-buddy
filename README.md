Nexis is a dual AI powered desk automation bot which uses raspberry pi to run a local llm and also uses a cloud deployed ai agent to do the tasks given to it in small chunks. We can give instructions through the interactive touch screen and also through the micophone. 
It uses esp32 to give commands to the device connected through the USB. 

## Overview

Nexis is a desk buddy which can do all sort of works upon good training and customisation. It uses a raspberry pi and open source AI model to break works into smaller steps. It uses the the local llm to generte the HID code respective to every step given uses python to asses if the work is performed then goes ahed with next step till all are completed. 
It uses esp32 to give HID code to the PC connected to make it do or perform a particular task. It can communicate or given instructionthrough the Touchscreen and Microphone.

### How It Works
- User gives an instruction.
- Nexis interprets the request.
- AI breaks the task into smaller steps.
- Local verification checks progress.
- ESP32 receives generated HID commands.
- Commands are executed on the connected computer.
- Nexis confirms completion and proceeds to the next step.

This process continues until the entire workflow is completed.

## Future Improvements

- It can work as full work automation
- It can also control the other tech stacks of your rooms
- If developed correctly it can do the job of any person

## Acknowledgement

- The raspberrry pi model 4 was alloted by my college (Jaypee Institute of Information Technology), which I am grateful.
- I am grateful for the oppurtunity presented by the Hack Club called fallout, Which I am a part of and am proud of making this project under their guidance for more reference realted to the fallout event (https://fallout.hackclub.com/path).
- I am also grateful for the help given by my seniors.
