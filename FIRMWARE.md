# Firmware Documentation

## Overview

The Nexis firmware runs on the ESP32-S3 and is responsible for converting approved actions into USB Human Interface Device (HID) events.

Unlike the Raspberry Pi, the ESP32-S3 does not perform AI processing or task planning. Its primary role is to act as a reliable keyboard and mouse controller for the connected computer.

## Hardware Connections

### Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

* Acts as the main processing unit.
* Runs the local AI models and backend services.
* Communicates with the ESP32-S3.
* Handles touchscreen interaction and task execution.

### Official Raspberry Pi Display

* Connected directly to the Raspberry Pi.
* Used for the Nexis user interface.
* Displays chats, status updates, and task progress.

### ESP32-S3

* Acts as the HID (Human Interface Device) controller.
* Receives commands from the Raspberry Pi.
* Emulates keyboard and mouse actions on the connected computer.

### INMP441 Microphone

* Connected to the Raspberry Pi through the I²S interface.
* Captures voice commands and audio input.
* Used for speech recognition and voice interaction.

### MAX98357A Amplifier

* Connected to the Raspberry Pi via I²S.
* Converts digital audio into speaker output.
* Provides audio feedback from Nexis.

### Speaker

* Connected to the MAX98357A amplifier.
* Outputs voice responses and system notifications.

### Rotary Encoder

* Connected to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
* Used for menu navigation and quick control.
* Supports rotation and push-button actions.

### Push Buttons

* Connected to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
* Used for shortcuts, confirmations, and system controls.

### LiPo Battery

* Powers the complete system.
* Enables portable operation.
* Can be paired with a charging and power management module.

WIN + R
```

---

### Mouse

Supported actions:

* Cursor movement
* Left click
* Right click
* Double click
* Scroll wheel

Examples:

```text
Move Cursor
Left Click
Scroll Down
Right Click
```

# Communication

The ESP32 receives commands from the Raspberry Pi.

Each command contains:

```json
{
  "action": "type",
  "value": "Hello World"
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "action": "hotkey",
  "keys": ["CTRL","S"]
}
```

---

# WiFi

Purpose:

* Device connectivity
* Communication with Raspberry Pi
* Status reporting

Features:

* Auto reconnect
* Connection monitoring
* Error recovery

```

---

## Press Key

Example:

```text
ENTER
ESC
TAB
```

---

## Hotkey

Example:

```text
CTRL + S
CTRL + SHIFT + T
ALT + TAB
```

---

## Mouse Click

Example:

```text
Left Click
Right Click
Double Click
```

---

## Mouse Move

Example:

```text
Move to X,Y
```

---

## Scroll

# Safety Features

The firmware does not independently decide actions.

Every action must originate from:

```text
User
 ↓
OAI
 ↓
Approval Screen
 ↓
Firmware
```

This prevents unintended execution.

---

# Error Handling

The firmware detects:

* Lost WiFi connection
* Invalid commands
* HID failures
* Communication timeouts

Recovery Actions:

```text
Reconnect
Retry
Report Status
```

---

# Future Improvements

Planned additions:

* OTA updates
* USB status detection
* Device pairing
* Advanced diagnostics
* Local command buffering

---

# Design Philosophy

The ESP32 should remain simple.

Responsibilities should stay limited to:

* Communication
* HID execution
* Status reporting

All complex processing should remain on the Raspberry Pi and OAI systems.
